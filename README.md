# Grandfather's Gift REMADE

This mod is directly inspired by [Grandfather's Gift 1.0 on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/985), but since that mod is not open source, I have to totally remake it from scratch.

Only the ideas remain; the code, the logic, even the words, everything came from my diabolical mind (with great help from my friends at [The Stardew Valley Forums](https://community.playstarbound.com/forums/mods.215/)).

## Configuration

I put in some knobs to fine tune the experience:

* `triggerDate` the day when the mod will trigger. Only the day is settable; the season is always "spring" and the year is always "1". Also, valid range is `2 <= triggerDate <= 28`; outside that range, the value will be clamped
* `giveChest` whether farmer will receive a FREE CHEST!!1! upon opening the gift, or just the weapon

## Discussion?

* Use [BitBucket's "Issues" system](https://bitbucket.org/pepoluan/sdvmod-grandfather-gift-remade/issues?status=new&status=open)
* On [this mod's thread](https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/remaking-grandfathers-gift.155872/) in the previously-linked Stardew Valley forums.
